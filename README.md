# SmileSchool Homepage — HTML & CSS Project

This project is part of the **ALX Frontend specialization**.  
The objective is to reproduce the SmileSchool landing page based entirely on a Figma designer file, focusing mainly on **CSS styling, responsiveness, and pixel-perfect layout**.

The HTML structure is based on the “HTML, advanced” project and has been improved where necessary to match the Figma design.
